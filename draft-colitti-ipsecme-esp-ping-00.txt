Abstract

1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Problem statement

   IPsec sessions between hosts that have global connectivity will by
   default use unencapsulated IPv6 ESP, i.e., IPv6 packets with a Next
   Header value of 50.  ESP packets may have advantages over ESP-in-UDP
   encapsulation, such as:

   *  They require fewer keepalive packets to keep sessions open.

      -  On some networks, ESP is be statelessly allowed in both
         directions, and thus not require any keepalive packets at all.
         For example, the IPv6 Simple Security recommendations [RFC6092]
         specify that ESP by default must always be allowed and not be
         subject to any timeouts.

      -  Even if ESP is not statelessly allowed, experience from real
         world networks is that timeouts for ESP are higher than for UDP
         sessions, thus requiring IPsec endpoints to send fewer
         keepalives.

   *  They provide slightly lower overhead, due to the absence of the
      UDP header.

   However, because ESP packets do not share fate with IKE packets, it
   is possible for the network to allow IKE packets but not ESP packets.
   This leads to the IPsec session not being able to exchange any
   packets even though IKE negotiation succeeded.  Because ESP is only

   used after IKE negotiation, this failure mode is difficult to
   predict, difficult to detect, and difficult to recover from.  In
   particular, migrating a session using MOBIKE [RFC4555] to a network
   that doe snot allow ESP could result in the session blackholing all
   future packets until the problem is detected and a new migration is
   performed to enable encapsulation.

   Operational experience suggests that networks and some home routers
   that drop ESP packets are common enough to be a problem for general
   purpose VPN applications desiring to work reliably on the Internet.

3.  Protocol Specification

   An IPsec peer, prior to an IKE negotiation, intending to verify
   network path's capability to support ESP packets to a specific
   destination, MAY send an ESP Echo Request packet to such destination.
   The ESP Echo Request packets are distinguished as ESP packets with an
   SPI value set to [ESP-ECHO-REQUEST], a Next Header value of 59 (No
   Next Header), and devoid of any payload.

   Should the destination support ESP and intend to communicate this
   capability to the potential IPsec peer, it SHOULD respond with an ESP
   Echo Reply packet.  These ESP Echo Reply packets are characterized as
   ESP packets with an SPI value set to [ESP-ECHO-REPLY], a Next Header
   value of 59, and are devoid of any payload.  The Echo request and
   response messages are not encrypted nor integerity proterctd.

   After completing an IPsec SA negotiation, [RFC7296], an IPsec peer
   wishing to verify the viability of the current network path for ESP
   packets MAY initiate an ESP Echo Request.  The ESP Echo Request
   packet MAY be encrypted.  If encrypted, it SHOULD utilize an SPI
   value previously negotiated through IKE and set the Next Header value
   to 59 (No Next Header).  The receiving IPsec peer, having established
   ESP through IKE, MAY issue an ESP Echo Response.  When replying to an
   encrypted ESP Echo Request, the ESP Echo Response MUST be encrypted
   and utilize the corresponding negotiated SPI.

4.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations are similar to other unconnected request-
   reply protocols such as ICMPv6 echo.  In particular:

   *  By sending an ESP Echo Request from a spoofed source address, an
      attacker could cause a server to send an ESP Echo Reply to that
      address.  This does not constitute an amplification attack because
      the ESP Echo Reply is the same size as the ESP Echo Request.  This
      can be prevented by implementing ingress filtering per BCP 38
      [RFC2827].

   *  An attacker can use ESP Echo Request packets to determine whether
      a particular destination address is an ESP endpoint.  This is not
      a new attack because any endpoint that supports ESP must also
      reply to IKE INIT packets.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo requests that IANA allocate two new values from the
   "Security Parameters Index (SPI)" registry.  The following entry
   should be appended:

              +========+==================+=================+
              | Number | Description      | Reference       |
              +========+==================+=================+
              | 7      | ESP Echo Request | [THIS DOCUMENT] |
              +--------+------------------+-----------------+
              | 8      | ESP Echo Reply   | [THIS DOCUMENT] |
              +--------+------------------+-----------------+
